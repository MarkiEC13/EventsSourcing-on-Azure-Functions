Configuration
=============

There are two aspects of the system configuration that can be changed without recompiling or redeploying the function app. 
that uses this event sourcing library: [EventStreamSettings] are the settings that describe how the physical data underlying
an event stream are stored and [EventMaps] which defines how event names (in business terms) are mapped to .NET classes.

In the latter case this can also be set at compile time with the [EventName] attribute.

The run time comfiguration is via environment strings where the key is the identifier of the event 
stream and the value is the setting in ; separated format.

e.g. "Bank.Account" = "Table;Bank.Account.ConnectionStringName"
You can replace the domain or entity type names with ALL to apply a global setting e.g.:-

"Bank.ALL" = "Table;RetailBankTableConnectionString"
